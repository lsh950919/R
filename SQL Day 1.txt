Introduction to SQL


COMMANDS

F5 - run all code
F9 - run current line of code

SHOW con_name; -> shows name of CDB
SELECT con_id, name FROM v$pdbs\SHOW pdbs; -> shows information about PDB

CREATE TABLESPACE (tablespace name) DATAFILE (data location) SIZE (size) AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT (size) MAXSIZE UNLIMITED
 - SIZE refers to initial size of table space, AUTOEXTEND refers to extending after max size, MAXSIZE UNLIMITED
has a limit of 13GB

CREATE USER (username) IDENTIFIED BY (password) DEFAULT TABLESPACE (tablespace name)
 - create username under password, and tables created by username is saved under tablespace name

GRANT (privilege/role) TO (username) - granting privilege/role to username

ALTER USER HR IDENTIFIED BY (password) ACCOUNT UNLOCK





CONCEPTS

Lecture 1-1

Database - 데이터를 쳬계적으로 모아 놓은 논리적인 집합

DBMS - DataBase Management System : 데이터베이스를관리하는 시스템

SQL is the most used DBMS program in the world, annd is a type of RDBMS
 - RDBMS - Relational DBMS

Characteristics of RDBMS
1. 데이터 중복 최소화
 * 스토리지 비용 절감 (categorization of repetitive data)
2. 데이터 무결성 (Integrity)
 * can limit or check for types of input data
3. 트랜젝션 처리
 * if error occurs, the transaction is considered nonexistent (thus cancelled wholly)
4. SQL을 이용한 손 쉬운 데이터 처리
5. 데이터 보안성 강화
 * uses authorization, roles, etc. to limit/grant access to various tables, data, etc.

Starting from version 12c, Multi-tenant Architecture feature was added.
 - originally, firms had to purchase each database for each purpose. However, with the new feature, these
databases, centered at CDB (Container Database), could be "plugged" in when at use, thus named PDB (Pluggable DB).


Lecture 1-2

Architecture of Oracle 18c Express:
1. CDB : CDB$ROOT (Root container)
2. PDB : PDB$SEED (used when PDB is created), XEPDB1 (automatically created PDB)

User - logs in to Oracle to manipulate the database
 * Command : CREATE USER username IDENTIFIED BY password
Schema - Amalgam of all items in database, follows the name of user

SYS and SYSTEM accounts (Admin accounts)
1. SYS - has all the access to the databases including database backup, restoration, etc.
2. SYSTEM - does not have the access to database backup, restoration, etc.
Both accounts have their own schemas, but they contain commands that are used to manipulate other created users
and the databases. Thus, all data is stored under other created schemas.

Privileges and Roles
1. Privileges - refers to the commands used to manipulate databases, two types: system and schema object privileges
 - System privileges - includes commands that admin accounts can grant access to users
   * EX. create user, create session, create table, etc.
 - schema object privileges - includes commands that can be used onto DB objects like tables and views
   * EX. select on
2. Roles - group of similar prvileges that can be granted as a whole
 - there are some basic roles already made, but they can be made as well
Command for granting system privilege/role: GRANT privilege/role name TO user
 - GRANT create user, create session TO user1;
 - GRANT DBA TO user1; (DBA is a built-in role)
Command for taking away system privilege/role : REVOKE privilege/role name FROM user

Tips on SQL Developer
1. use F5 to run code on whole page, F9 to run current line of code
2. all line must end with ;
3. for creating pdb database, service name (bottom of screen for making databases) must be selected and given


Lecture 1-3: Tables

Table: 2D obejct in a database
 - easiest form to see data
 - consists of rows and columns: columns represent the data type, rows represent objects information (info about specific person, etc.)

A table is defined by its columns, not its rows
 - this is because columns have all the information as to describing our input data
 - Thus, when CREATE TABLE is performed, all column names must go in in order to create the table
   * CREATE TABLE emp(emp_no varchar(x) not null, emp_name varchar(y) not null, etc.)

3 Types of data inside a table: String, Number, and Date
 - String: char/varchar(x)
   * char max 2000 bytes, varchar max 4000 bytes
   * x represents maximum length of the text input, varchar is used more often as char fixes the length by x even when it is given a shorter one ('A' for char(3) -> 'A  '), usually keep the number big for varchar (varchar(100))

 - Number(p,s)
   * 22 byte
   * p(precision) - whole length of number
   * s(scale) - number of decimals
   * if p and s are not specified, max length is 38 digits
   * ex. 123.89 -> number(3) -> 124, 123.89 -> number(3,2) -> error, 123.89 -> number(6,1) -> 123.89

 - Date: date/timestamp
   * date - 7 byte, includes year, month, day, hour, minute, second -> used more often
   * timestamp - larger (11 byte), second is measured up to 9 digits

null - represents no data
not null - represents that a data MUST be input in order to not show any error

Primary Key - each data in column must be not null and UNIQUE
 - if a non-unique value is input, it gives error
 - this can be applied to multiple columns (ex. column1 1 column3 1 must be unique) ***
